The project aims to create a database for a vehicle company, generate synthetic data, and create a real-time connection between MySQL and Tableau for visualization of stored data.

As you can see from the picture, the database has been designed with a star schema model. You can see the fact table: Truck_Sales with the information of all truck sales and the dimension tables: Vehicles, Variants, Customer, Location, and Dealer, which are interconnected with the fact table Truck_Sales and each other through the fact table.
